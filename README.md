### Hey, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹
I am Pulkit Batra, a CSE Undergraduate from IIIT NAGPUR. I am a technology enthusiast with expertise in all major programming languages, including C/C++, Java, and Python. I began my coding career by learning C++ in class 11th and have been in the technology field ever since. 
 
I am deeply passionate about software engineering and as the lone coder in my internship, I not only developed the entire application but also participated in brainstorming and producing a research paper. I am a quick learner and who takes responsibilities seriously.
 
I practice regularly on geeksforgeeks and leetcode which has helped me improve my coding speed and understanding of data structures. Also, I have a keen interest in Machine Learning, Data Science and Natural Language Processing. Writing clean and robust code is my priority.
